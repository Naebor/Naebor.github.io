        <p>Naebor, Inc. (“Naebor”) has adopted this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain how Naebor collects, stores, and uses the information collected in connection with Naebor's products, services, and websites (together “Services”).</p>
        <p>Should you have any questions relating to this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@naebor.net">contact@naebor.net</a>.</p>
        <p>Naebor reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at reasonable times, so please review it frequently. Your continued use of Services will signify your acceptance of the changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>1. Non-personal Data</h3>
      <div style="font-size:16.5px">
        <p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “non-personal data” means information that does not directly identify you. Additionally, non-personal data means “aggregate” and “de-personalized” information, which is data Naebor collects about the use of Naebor Services, from which any personally identifiable data has been removed.</p>
        <p>Naebor may use tools or third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain non-personal data that does not directly enable Naebor to identify you.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>2. Personal Data</h3>
      <div style="font-size:16.5px">
        <p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personal data” means personally identifiable information that specifically identifies you as an individual.</p>
        <p>Likely situations when you make personal data available to Naebor include, but are not limited to: (i) registration for Services, including leaderboards; (ii) subscribing to newsletters; (iii) requesting technical support; and (iv) otherwise through use of Naebor Services where personal data is required for use and/or participation.</p>
        <p>The types of personal data may vary depending on the type of activity you are engaged in. The personal data Naebor may collect, process and use may include, but are not limited to your name, screen/user name, Naebor Services' or third party service ID, e-mail address.</p>
        <p>Naebor may use personal and non-personal data, both individually and combined together, for purposes of analyzing usage of the Services, providing customer and technical support, managing and providing Services (including managing advertisement serving), customizing Naebor's communications and to further develop the Services and other Naebor services and products. Naebor may combine non-personal data with personal data.</p>
        <p>From time to time, we may ask you to complete a voluntary survey in order to help us provide a better user experience. We will only request and therefore collect non-personal data.</p>
        <p>Naebor may use your personal data to send messages to you with informative and/or commercial content about Naebor's services or third party products and services Naebor thinks may be of interest to you, such as new features and services, special offers and updated information.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>3. Ad Serving Technology</h3>
      <div style="font-size:16.5px">
        <p>Naebor reserves the right to use and disclose the collected non-personal data for purposes of advertisement by Naebor or Naebor's partners and contractors. Naebor may employ third party ad serving technologies that use certain methods to collect information as a result of ad serving through Services. Naebor or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use demographic and location information as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Service. Naebor or third parties may collect and use data for this purpose including, but not limited to IP address (including but not limited to for purposes of determining your coarse location), Device ID, MAC, software, applications, hardware, and in-game information. The foregoing data may be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology.</p>
        <p>You recognize and agree that the advertising companies who deliver ads for Naebor may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. These ad serving technologies are integrated into Services; if you do not want to be subject to this technology, do not use or access Services.</p>
        <p>Naebor may display to you behaviorally targeted advertising. If you want to be certain that no behaviorally targeted advertisements are not displayed to you, please do not use or access the Services.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>4. Location Data</h3>
      <div style="font-size:16.5px">
        <p>We do not use or collect your precise geographic location.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>5. Data Retention</h3>
      <div style="font-size:16.5px">
        <p>Naebor may retain the data collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Thereafter if the collected data is no longer needed for purposes specified in this Privacy Policy, Naebor deletes all aforementioned data in its possession within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>6. Cookies, Beacons and Tracking</h3>
      <div style="font-size:16.5px">
        <p>The Services may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags, locally shared objects, and web beacons. Naebor treats information collected by cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>7. Third Party Terms and Conditions</h3>
      <div style="font-size:16.5px">
        <p>To operate the service, we also may make identifiable and anonymous information available to third parties in these limited circumstances: (1) with your express consent, (2) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, (3) when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to protect our rights or property, or (4) to any successor or purchaser in a merger, acquisition, liquidation, dissolution or sale of assets. Your consent will not be required for disclosure in these cases, but we will attempt to notify you, to the extent permitted by law to do so.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>8. Other</h3>
      <div style="font-size:16.5px">
        <p>If you are under 13 years of age or a minor in your country of residence, please ask your legal guardian's permission to use or access the Services. Naebor encourages parents and/or guardians to play an active role in their children's online experience at all times. Naebor does not knowingly contact or collect information from children under 13.</p>
